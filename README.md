Welcome to our GitHub repository for the CryptStego Web Platform!

## CryptStego: Enhancing Data Security Through Cryptography and Steganography

CryptStego is an innovative web application developed using Python and powered by Flask, a microservice-based framework. Our project showcases a powerful blend of cryptography and steganography, offering a robust solution for securing sensitive data across unsecured networks.

### Key Features:

- **Cryptography:** We have incorporated a state-of-the-art symmetric key-based encryption mechanism to ensure that your confidential data remains shielded from unauthorized access. Our application seamlessly encrypts and decrypts data, maintaining its integrity and confidentiality.

- **Steganography:** Our platform employs a modified LSB (Least Significant Bit) approach in steganography. This technique enables users to hide information within digital media, adding an additional layer of security to your data. 

### Why CryptStego?

In an increasingly interconnected world, the need for data security has never been more critical. CryptStego addresses this concern by providing a comprehensive platform that combines cryptography and steganography techniques. Whether you're sending confidential documents or simply sharing personal information, CryptStego ensures your data remains secure even when transmitted over unsecured networks.
